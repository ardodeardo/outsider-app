## About The Project
Hi there!

This is one of my prototyping material that was designed and developed by myself. The design itself was inspired by multiple news portal, but overall design was adopted by [insider.com](https://www.insider.com/)

Checkout the design on my [figma.com/@ardodeardo](https://www.figma.com/@ardodeardo) :v:

## Built With
